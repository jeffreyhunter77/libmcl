What Is This?
=============

This is a set of old utility classes written in C++ that I had lying
around and decided to bring out and update a little in case anyone else
finds them interesting or useful.

Essentially these are utility classes that have a different philosophy
behind them than the STL. Mostly I just wanted to toss these out there so
that I had something to reference when talking about approaches that are
different from the STL. There's more code and more information to come at
some point, but for now, the most useful thing to look at is the header
file in inc/mcl/String.h.
